# DroneDynamoDB_Fall2022

This is the working Github respository for my DynamoDB drone project. This part in particular is due on October 16th (this sunday).
I am about to download the TelloPy files from the other GitHub and begin work. I also have the drive of past students projects open.


Hi! A bit later now and I have done a bit.
First I updated the version of Python on my computer and updated my Visual Studio version to use Python.
Then I cloned the git respository from the TelloPy page, and opened setup.py and test_XBOX.py to see what was going on.

Little later, more issues and more solutions.
I was really struggling to get Python to play nice with my computer and did not know why.
The problem was I was putting Mac style commands into the Windows command prompt
After that I was able to install the files and run them on my machine
Don't have the ability to test at this moment so I will do that tomorrow
